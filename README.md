# windows10-issues
a list of windows 10 issues I faced and soutions, for my own reference


## weird driver issue:
Had issue with sound and intel graphics drivers, they keep getting set to a wrong version of the driver, and can't use premiere. And microphone does not pick up much sound.    
Solution: went to device manager, update driver - browse my computer - let me pick - and then picked a driver. Seems to work? Although have no idea why it goes wrong and why it worked in the end...
